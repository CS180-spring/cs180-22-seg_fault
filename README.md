# Project-CS180

- For our project interface, our current plan is to use the terminal.
    * The user can use the functionalities of our system by inputting number values to select described menu options. 
    * Users can create documents, read existing documents, update any existing documents, and delete documents that are no longer needed.
    * The users are able to sort the documents by document attributes such as name or last modified date.
    * Users are able to create collections that store documents; an example of this in Windows is creating a folder that contains multiple .txt files. 
    * Collection attributes can be updated such as their name or last modified date and can also be sorted by their attributes.

- If time permits, we hope to implement a frontend GUI for our project interface. 
    * Rather than inputting number values in a terminal, the user is presented with a webpage that has the same menu options.
    * The user should be able to click buttons that accomplish the same tasks as the terminal version described above.
    * When the user is prompted to input values such as for renaming, an input field is shown for the user to input into.
